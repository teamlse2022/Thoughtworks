# Thoughworks: LSE Data Analytics Employer Partner

## This repo is to store the Jupyter Notebook containing code, analysis, & insights for the Employer Partner Project.

### Objective of the project is to study cycling data in 3 major cities in order to explore for London:

- Whether cycling uptake can be increased

- The factors which determine the choice to cycle

- The changes to the transport network that have been the most impactful

Additionally, the project will explore:

- Demographic characteristics of London's cyclists

- Potential to engage with under-represented groups to increase overall cycling uptake.
