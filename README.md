## Repo to store analysis, associated code, report & presentation for LSE Employer Project.

### Objective of the project is to study cycling data in 3 major cities in order to explore:

- How can we increase cycling uptake?

- What factors determine whether people cycle?

- What changes to transport networks have had the greatest impact?

Additionally, the project will explore demographic data for each city to determine if there are any underrepresented demographic groups in London that can be engaged with in order to increase the overall uptake of cycling in the city.
